# COVID-19-Data-Amalysis-using-Python

Here we work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  We merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

# Conclusion

We conclude that the countries with high GDP are likely to have more cases of covid-19, which eventually will decrease the happiness of the people living in that country.
